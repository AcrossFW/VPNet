VPNet(Very Powerful Network Encryption Toolbox) is a modern, open source, strong encryption and easy to use docker image for bypassing the censorship circumvention systems, which helps people gain access to the global internet free of censorship, without knowledge of what is being blocked or the underlying technical.

We believe that the right of visiting free and open global internet is right that all people should enjoy – both technic and the non-technic people.

## Goal

The Goal of VPNet is to satisfy those needs in above story, with the following highlights.

3. All in One
    5. SSH Tunnel
    3. PPTP
    6. Squid Proxy
    1. ShadowSocks
    2. OpenVPN
    4. IPsec
2. Extreme Easy to Setup
    1. Build, Ship, Run with Docker
    2. Compatible with any modern Cloud Hosting Provider(VPS)
    3. One Command for All
1. Professional
    1. Stable Connection
    2. Strong Encryption
    3. Decentralized

Being an Anti-Censorship Technology, VPNet has to try the best to adapt.

> “Every time censors try a new technique, the tool developers adapt, keeping thousand of users connected to the global internet.”

>   Malinowski, _Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor_

## Quick Start

VPNet is extreme easy to deploy by only one command, because it was built & shiped by docker:

```shell
docker run -d \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  --restart=always \
  --name=vpnet \
  acrossfw/vpnet
```

You are set. Cheers!

### Default Username and Password

* Username: vpnet
* Password: vpnet.io

Enjoy!

### Custom Configuration

You can change the default configuration by passing the environment variables when start/restart the docker container.

For example, if you want to specify the shadowsocks port, you can set `PORT_SHADOWSOCKS` environment when restarting the docker container:

```shell
export PORT_SHADOWSOCKS=8388
docker stop $(docker ps -a --filter name=vpnet -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a --filter name=vpnet -q)
docker run -d \
  --privileged \
  --net=host \
  --restart=always \
  --name=vpnet \
  -e PORT_SHADOWSOCKS=${PORT_SHADOWSOCKS} \
  acrossfw/vpnet
```
